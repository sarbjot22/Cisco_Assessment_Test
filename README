Usage Instruction: 

######
Following things are required to be done.

1. Run this shell script from any Linux server which has access to internet

2. Run aws configure to connect to appropriate AWS account with role having permission to create resources on AWS

3. Ensure jq utility is installed, if not installed, please run yum -y install jq


Post above pre requ

Execute ./creatInfra.sh

IT will 
 - create the VPC
 - subnet in different regions
 - security group with access on port 22 and 80
 - create keypair
 - create one EC2 webservers in one of the subnet and region
 - Install Nginx, create custom html, configure it,  and start the service
 - Create the ELB 
 - Configure ELB by creating target group, listener and registering targets


Entire automation is done using AWS CLI 

Please note, you need to enter yes, when asked by script, its used for first time connection to newly created EC2 instances.

This script is working fine, test and giving expected results.

########

Approach:



Before execution this script checks if any Ec2 instance is in running stage, if Yes, it will stop else move to next test

It will check if any load balancer is Active, if Yes, it will stop else progress with the instance creation

This script creates the VPC, subnet, internet gateway, route table and so on

User has complete access to modify and control this, if there is existing setup, please provide corresponding VPCID, subnetIDs to script

If nothing is provided this tool will assume nothing is created and create all network resources like VPC, subnet and so on

When this tool completes execution, please with for 5 minutes to check load balancer url, as instance registration may be still happening in background.
Summary: User has complete control on the VPC, subnet etc otherwise tool will take care of it.

Bonus question:

We can cosnider to put throttling at Nginx end by limiting the numnber of requests per seconf, we need to add following line
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=10r/s;

We anyway have option of using Autoscale group where in upon reaching specific usage or number of requests, new instance will be automatically spinned up
